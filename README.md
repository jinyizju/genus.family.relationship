# genus.family.relationship

This repository contains the information of genus family relationships for angiosperms (source: APG4), gymnosperms (source: Apweb) and pteridophytes (source: TPL). The V.PhyloMaker2 and/or V.PhyloMaker users could use the information to standardize the family names of their species lists, before they input the species lists and run the package functions to generate the phylogenies.
