# genus.family.relationship-

This repository contains the information of genus family relationships for angiosperms (source: APG4), gymnosperms (source: Apweb) and pteridophytes (source: TPL). The V.PhyloMaker2 and/or V.PhyloMaker users could use these information to standardize the family names of their species lists, before they input the species list and run the functions to generate the phylogenies.
